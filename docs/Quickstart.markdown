### Memory Requirements

Memory requirements for running an Owncloud server are greatly variable, depending on the numbers of users and files, and volume of the server activity. Owncloud officially requires a minimum of 128MB RAM. But, it is recommended a minimum of 512MB RAM. 

### Database Requirements

The following are currently required if youâ€™re running Owncloud together with a MySQL or MariaDB database:

* Disabled or `BINLOG_FORMAT = MIXED or BINLOG_FORMAT = ROW` configured Binary Logging, see [MySQL / MariaDB with Binary Logging Enabled](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.html#mysql-mariadb-with-binary-logging-enabled).

* InnoDB storage engine, see [MySQL / MariaDB storage engine](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.html#mysql-mariadb-storage-engine).

* `READ COMMITED` transaction isolation level, see [MySQL / MariaDB READ COMMITED transaction isolation level](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.html#mysql-mariadb-read-commited-transaction-isolation-level).
<br />
<br />

## Chapter 2. Installing and Configuring Owncloud Using Docker

This chapter describes how to install and configure the Owncloud server using Docker Compose. 

The process consists of configuring the environment, creating the containers, stopping the containers, connecting users to the Owncloud server using the server's IP address and port 8080 and logging in to the Owncloud server.

### Prerequisites

* The host machine must be able to connect to the Internet.
* Ensure the default port for HTTP, 8080, is accessible. 
* Docker is installed and Docker daemon is running.

#### NOTE
> If you want to run Docker without root privileges, see [Run the Docker daemon as a non-root user (Rootless mode)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/).

### Procedure

<span>1.</span> Verify that Docker is installed.
<br />

```
$ sudo docker info
```
Example:

```
Client:
Context:    default
Debug Mode: false
Plugins:
 app: Docker App (Docker Inc., v0.9.1-beta3)
 buildx: Build with BuildKit (Docker Inc., v0.5.1-docker)
 scan: Docker Scan (Docker Inc., v0.6.0)

Server:
Containers: 4
Running: 4
Paused: 0
Stopped: 0
Images: 21
Server Version: 20.10.5
Storage Driver: overlay2
```
<br />

If you get the output, skip the next step. If you see `docker: command not found`, continue to the next step *Install Docker*.

<span>2.</span> [Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) Docker.
<br />

<span>3.</span> Create a new project directory.
<br />

```
$ sudo mkdir owncloud-docker-server
```

<span>4.</span> Change the current directory.
<br />

```
$ cd owncloud-docker-server
```

#### NOTE
> Go to the directory where your .yaml and .env files are located to be able to run `docker-compose` commands.

<span>5.</span> Copy docker-compose.yml from the GitHub repository.
<br />

```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owncloud/docs/master/modules/admin_manual/examples/installation/docker/docker-compose.yml
```

<span>6.</span> Create the environment configuration file. The configuration exposes port 8080, to allow HTTP connections. It uses separate MariaDB and Redis containers and mounts the data and MySQL data directories on the host for persistent storage.
<br />

```
$ cat << EOF > .env
OWNCLOUD_VERSION=10.7
OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN=localhost:8080
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
HTTP_PORT=8080
EOF
```

#### NOTE
> `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` do not change between deploys even if the values in the .env file are changed. Do `docker volume prune` to change those values. Which deletesall your data. 

> The following instructions assume you install locally. For remote access, the value of `OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN` must be adapted.

<span>7.</span> Build and start the container
<br />

```
$ sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Example:

```
$ docker-compose up -d          
Docker Compose is now in the Docker CLI, try `docker compose up`

Creating owncloud_mariadb ... done
Creating owncloud_redis   ... done
Creating owncloud_server  ... done
```

<span>8.</span> Check that all the containers have successfully started.
<br />

Example:

```
docker-compose ps   
      Name                    Command                  State               Ports         
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
owncloud_mariadb   docker-entrypoint.sh --max ...   Up (healthy)   3306/tcp              
owncloud_redis     docker-entrypoint.sh --dat ...   Up (healthy)   6379/tcp              
owncloud_server    /usr/bin/entrypoint /usr/b ...   Up (healthy)   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
``` 

## 2.1 Stop the Containers

<span>1.</span> You can stop the containers using `docker-compose` command. Run the command below.
<br />

```
$ sudo docker-compose stop
```
Example: 

```
$ sudo docker-compose stop     
Stopping owncloud_server  ... done
Stopping owncloud_mariadb ... done
Stopping owncloud_redis   ... done
```

<span>2.</span> Stop and remove containers, along with the related networks, images, and volumes. Run the command below.
<br />

```
$ sudo docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes
```

Example:

```
$ sudo docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes
Removing owncloud_server  ... done
Removing owncloud_mariadb ... done
Removing owncloud_redis   ... done
Removing network owncloud-docker-server_default
Removing volume owncloud-docker-server_files
Removing volume owncloud-docker-server_mysql
Removing volume owncloud-docker-server_redis
Removing image mariadb:10.5
Removing image redis:6
Removing image owncloud/server:10.7
```

<span>3.</span> Verify that containers are removed.
<br />

```
$ sudo docker-compose ps
```

Example:

```
$ sudo docker-compose ps
Name   Command   State   Ports
------------------------------
```
<br />
<br />
