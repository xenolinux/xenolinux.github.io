# What is Owncloud?

Owncloud is open-source file sync, share, and content collaboration software that lets teams work on data easily from anywhere, on any device.
It provides access to your data through a web interface while providing a platform to view, sync, and share across devices easily. Owncloud 
provides ready-to-deploy packages for popular Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and 
OpenSUSE. Owncloud can be installed using Docker as well.
